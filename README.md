# Rosseta üß¨ ‚Äì DNA Sequence Assembly & Analysis Tool

Rosseta is a C++ desktop application developed for DNA sequence generation, assembly, and genome comparison. It uses **graph-based algorithms** (like De Bruijn graphs and Eulerian paths) to reconstruct DNA sequences from k-mer reads. This project was built as part of an academic course on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.
